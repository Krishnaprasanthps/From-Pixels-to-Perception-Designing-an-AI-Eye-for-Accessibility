# From-Pixels-to-Perception-Designing-an-AI-Eye-for-Accessibility
This project tackles the daily challenges faced  by the visually impaired by deploying an AI-powered object  detection system. Utilizing the SSD algorithm, our tool  accurately identifies surrounding objects and relays their  presence through an audio jack, enhancing spatial awareness  and independent navigation.
